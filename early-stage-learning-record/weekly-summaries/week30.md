# Week30

## Reproducing classical DRL algorithms using Pytorch:

1. DDPG: does not follow any existing repo and build from the bottom up
2. TD3: based on the self-implemented DDPG and add module
3. SAC: based on the self-implemented DDPG and add module

## Matlab 2019b Reinforcement Learning Toolbox:

1. Grid World with Q-learning
2. Carpole with REINFORCE
3. Watertank model with DDPG

## Paper reading and reviewing:

1. Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor Critic Methods
2. Continuous Control with Deep Learning
3. REVIEW: Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q learning
4. REVIEW: Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms
5. Soft Actor Critic Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor
6. Q-PROP: SAMPLE EFFICIENT POLICY GRADIENT WITH AN OFF-POLICY CRITIC
