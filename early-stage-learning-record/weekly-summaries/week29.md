# Week29

- CS234: Reinforcement Learning
    - Lecture 2 3 4 and Assignment 2
    - permanently solve the problem of forgetting Bellman Equations, Policy Iteration and Value Iteration: read and thin the whole book by construct specific model of the algorithm process. Focus on the intuitive way and use it to write the equations from memory.
- CS285
    - Lecture on Meta Learning and things from Information Theory
- Book
    - Baysian Data Analysis (chapter 1 2): chapters about Baysian Inference and Baysian Inversion Problems. Because the approaching ending of this semester and the DDLs coming along with it, I have to deal with projects from other courses, one of those require me to use Baysian Method to analysise Model parameters. I plan to take the opportunity to further study the Baysian Method used in Reinforcement Learning (First step is to review the Probability Course Notes and then learn deeper knowledge in this book)
    - Reinforcement Learning an Introduction (chapter 3 4): re-Read for better understanding. "Read more and read under the lines." I act according to this line and get rid lots of useless notes from the book and only record the essential ones.
- Papers
    - Learning Multimodal Representations with Factorized Deep Generative Models
    - Deep Verifier Networks: Verification of Deep Discriminative Models with Deep Generative Models
    - Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model
