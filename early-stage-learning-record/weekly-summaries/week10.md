# week10

* finish *reinforcement learning : an introduction* chapter10 : On-policy Control with Approximation and chapter11 : Off-policy Methods with Approximation
* Exploration several different platform and tools for RL:
  1. Mathematica with its System Model (A bit out of fashion and few tutorial)
  2. Dopamine (Google OpenSource Platform)
  3. Pytorch (Both Python and Rust : a relatively lower language may lead to higher performance and speed than Python)
  4. Julia language : start with simple optimization problem (already feel better than R and Matlab ) and will try to implement RL algorithms with it next week
* Finish half the course review of Probability (right before the condition expectation)
