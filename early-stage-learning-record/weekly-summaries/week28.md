# Week28

- CS332: Advanced Survey of Reinforcement Learning
    - A course that guides the way to Deep Reinforcement Learning Research and give an example on classification of research papers
    - My basic plan is to follow this and reproduce each one
    - This week: reproduce "Behavioral Cloning with Observation"
- Setup a plan to get the "Basic Skills for a Data Scientist"
    - This Week: develop a detailed study of SVM, Kernel Method and SMO. The goal is to really understand the fundational knowledge and build the modern method from the bottom up.
    - In the following weeks, I will start from CEM, CRF, LDA to GCN GNN and so on.
- CS234: Reinforcement Learning
    - the Essential of the course is the after lecture Note which give a very clear explaination about the topic it has addressed and especially emphasize the deeper math before the surface.
    - This week: Lecture 2 and Lecture 3.
