# week-five-report

* As planned, I finished the online course of RL. However, due to three exams in the  past week, I barely did exercises. I will do a review on all 9 lectures next week after the CA exam in Wednesday and do some exercise s later on.
* When I go through the RL course and some online material about RL, I found that there are lots of overlapped knowledge in RL and other aspects of ML which makes me realize that a general view of ML is quite necessary. I picked two books to read after the CA exam to achieve the goal:
  * 周志华：《机器学习》
    * have already finished the first three chapters
  * Pattern Recognition And Machine Learning
    * have already finished the chapter one
