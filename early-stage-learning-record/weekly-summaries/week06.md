# week-six-report

1. as planned, I reviewed half of the course this week.
   1. Basic
   2. Planning and RL (Basically prediction and control with the underlying MDP)
   3. Policy Iteration and Value Iteration
      1. iterative policy evaluation — policy evaluation 
      2. greedy policy improvement — policy improvement 
   4. MC & TD & SARSA
      1. three kinds of algorithms both in the aspect of prediction and control
      2. Complete and incomplete episode iteration
      3. full and partial update
      4. On-policy and off-policy control
      5. Q-learning also as SARSAMAX
2. Keep reading the books PRML and RL : an intro
   1. Mainly focus on the bayesian probability in ML
3. review the basic probability (SI140)
