# Week31

Due to the coming deadline and tight schedule, I mainly focus on reading papers this week.

## Papers:

1. Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning
2. An information-theoretic approach to curiosity-driven reinforcement learning
3. Information-Based Exploration for Reinforcement Learning
4. Information-directed Exploration for Deep Reinforcement Learning
5. If MaxEnt RL is the Answer, What is the Question?
6. An Information-Theoretic Optimality Principle for Deep Reinforcement Learning
7. Reinforcement Learning with Deep Energy-Based Policies
